GIRLFRIEND
Tonight we are going to have a great time! Let me call up Lisa.

FATHER
I said I can't go. You know I am busy working late tonight.

GIRLFRIEND
You work too much. You need to relax every now and then. It is not healthy to stay at work all the time.

FATHER
You don't understand. This is important. These guys are coming in tonight and I want everything ready before they get here.

GIRLFRIEND
Who? Who is coming? What is so important that you can't spend one night out with your friends? You never even do that. Why should it be different this time?

FATHER
Listen. Listen... There's been some trouble. Things that happened in my past have caught up to us. They found the warehouse. Now they will come after us looking for payback.

GIRLFRIEND
Them again? That bunch of criminals? But we had nothing to do with what happened. We were just there, helping them move goods. And now because of this they think they have the right to destroy us. We have lived in peace. They have no reason to bother us.

FATHER
We should have left town long ago. We knew this would happen eventually. But we stayed. Because we had roots here. Family. Friends. People who care about us. And because we didn't want to give in to them. To let them take over our lives.

GIRLFRIEND
That is not a good enough reason to stay here anymore, dad. I am sorry but I cannot spend the rest of my life hiding and waiting for these people to strike again. It is wrong. It is unfair. It is dangerous!

FATHER
You are young and don't understand yet how the world works. One day you will learn that the bad guys never lose. It is just a matter of time.

GIRLFRIEND
I know. But not when it concerns me. I can't live like this anymore, daddy.

FATHER
Go to Lisa's then. Get out of my sight. I need to work.

GIRLFRIEND
Dad... I love you. I always will. No matter
