JOHN DOE (voiceover)
I used to think I was an ordinary man.
I had a wife, I had a job, I even had a dog.
But things are not always what they seem...

(The camera pans across the lush countryside and we see a small white farmhouse. The door opens and John Doe steps out of the house carrying a little girl who giggles as she runs away from him.)

NARRATOR
John Doe and his family lived deep within the woods, far from civilization.

(The camera follows John Doe, who is followed by his daughter.)

JOHN DOE (voiceover)
They lived a simple life and everything seemed perfect.

(We hear laughter as the two of them run through the tall grass. We see the smile on John's face and the joy in Mary Jane's eyes.)

NARRATOR
Then came the night that changed everything...

(Suddenly, the camera shakes as if someone is running towards it. The sound of gunshots rings out as the screen fills with smoke and flames. We see John trying to protect his daughter but is unable to escape before their house is burned to the ground.)

And now I am all alone...

(We see John standing amidst the wreckage of his home, looking down at his lifeless daughter.)
